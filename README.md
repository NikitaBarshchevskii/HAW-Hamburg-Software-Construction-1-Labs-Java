# HAW-Hamburg-Software-Construction-2-Labs-Java
This repository contains my solutions and projects from the Software Construction 2 labs at HAW Hamburg, focusing on Java programming.
## Lab 1
<details><summary>Description</summary>
In Lab 1 the task was to create several classes which combined represent an animal (a horse in my case). The following requirements were followed:
- Identified at least 10 parts of the animal and described their relationships.
- Created a UML class diagram illustrating the domain.
- Implemented classes for each identified object, providing relevant properties, constructors, and drawAt(int left, int bottom) methods in accordance with the UML diagram.
- Developed a main animal class with a drawAt(int left, int bottom) method to manage drawing of its constituent parts. Each part class has its own drawAt(int left, int bottom) method to render itself.
- Evaluated the output to ensure alignment with expectations, determining optimal points for combining object components.
- Ensured code conformity with prescribed code conventions, promoting readability and clarity.
